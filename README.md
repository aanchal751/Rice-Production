# Rice-Production
🌾 Rice Production Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of rice production data from various Indian states, aimed at understanding yield patterns, production trends, and regional performance over time. The notebook is written in Python and uses libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

📌 Project Highlights
✅ Data Cleaning: Unused columns such as district codes and names are removed to streamline analysis.
🔄 Column Reordering: Reorganized dataset to prioritize production and yield values.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is visualized to understand production trends and insights (e.g., top producing states, average yields).
📈 Visualizations: Line plots, bar charts, and possibly trendlines (based on the full notebook) for clearer understanding of temporal and geographical patterns.
